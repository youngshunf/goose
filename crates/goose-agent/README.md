# goose-agent

The GDK's agent loop, unrolled into a state machine you assemble yourself.

Instead of a fixed "call the model, run the tools, repeat" loop, an agent here is
an ordered list of steps. Each step gets a chance to look at the conversation and
either decline or produce effects. The machine walks the list, applies the first
step that applies, and starts over from the top — so the whole agent's behavior
is a function of the persisted conversation, not of in-memory loop state.

## The pieces

- **`Operation<S, E>`** — one step. Implement `run` to act on the conversation,
  plus any of `inference_tools`, `prompt_parts`, and `moim_parts` to contribute
  to the model request. Returns `OperationResult::NotApplicable` to pass, or
  `applied(..)` / `yielded(..)` to take the step. Helpers: `not_applicable()`,
  `applied()`, `yielded()`, `yielded_with()`.
- **`Inference<S, E>`** — the step that reaches the provider. Before calling it,
  the machine collects tools and prompt parts from *every* operation in the list
  into an `InferenceInput`.
- **`ToolOperation<S>`** — adapts caller-defined `rmcp` tools into one operation.
  Register `SyncTool<S>` and `AsyncTool<S>` implementations with the typed builder
  methods, or implement `ToolProvider<S>` for tools discovered dynamically per
  session. Dynamic providers are queried before inference and again before
  execution, so their tool names and handlers must remain stable between those
  boundaries. Their schemas are sent to inference and matching calls are
  dispatched against the current session.
- **`StateMachine<'a, S, E>`** — holds `Vec<Step<..>>` and a `CancellationToken`.
  `step()` runs one pass, `apply()` writes effects back, `run()` loops until a
  step yields to the client or no step applies.
- **`ConversationEffect`** — the default effect type: `AppendMessage`,
  `ReplaceConversation`, `PatchToolRequestMeta`, `SetMessageVisibility`. Bring
  your own by implementing `MachineEffect`.
- **`Emitter`** — streams `AgentEvent`s (`Message`, `Usage`, `MessageUsage`,
  `McpNotification`, `HistoryReplaced`) to the client while a step runs, and
  carries the cancellation token.
- **`SessionLoader`** / **`EffectHandler`** / **`MachineSession`** — the traits
  your runtime implements so the machine can load a session by id and persist
  effects. The machine reloads the session between passes; it never caches it.

## Reading the conversation

Because steps re-derive their decisions from history, the crate ships the
predicates they need: `messages_since_kickoff`, `last_effective_role`,
`assistant_turn_count`, `ends_turn`, and `trailing_error`. When a step must
remember that it already did something, it records that on the message itself via
`Operation::set_message_meta` / `message_meta` rather than in memory.

## Cancellation

Cancellation is cooperative. Once the token fires, remaining steps are treated as
not-applicable and each step's `cancel` hook gets a chance to rewrite its result;
anything applied while cancelled yields to the client.

## WebAssembly

The crate builds for `wasm32-unknown-unknown` and runs without a tokio runtime,
so it can be embedded in a JavaScript host. There, the clock and randomness come
from JavaScript. Some things differ from native:

- The traits you implement (`Provider`, `Operation`, `ToolProvider`,
  `SessionLoader`, `EffectHandler`, and the rest) do not require `Send` or
  `Sync`, and neither does `MessageStream`. So you can await JavaScript promises
  and hold host handles directly. Implement the traits with
  `#[async_trait(?Send)]`. The bounds are `MaybeSend` and `MaybeSync` from
  `goose_provider_types::maybe_send`, which are the real `Send` and `Sync`
  natively.
- `SyncTool`s run inline instead of on a blocking thread, so cancellation cannot
  interrupt one that has started.
- `ProviderRetry` waits between attempts on the host's `setTimeout` instead of
  tokio's timer, so retries work without a tokio runtime.

The reference assembly of these pieces is `goose::agents::state_machine` in the
[`goose`](../goose) crate.
